Dear Sonu,

I arrived here on the 29th morning. Tomorrow to Thirthahalli, on the 3rd and 4th, in Ripponpet and Hosanagara, outdoor gatherings have been organised. Once I finish this program, I shall leave by train on the night of the 4th and be there at Bangalore for the Assembly session to be conducted on the 05/02/1965.

I haven’t been able to go to Brother’s house yet. I am planning to visit today evening. Mother’s health seems to be improving. She is eager to go to the village. I have convinced her to stay back at Thirthahalli, this entire month.

I wish to convey a piece of good news to you. There is a program fixed for us to go to Goa, for the coming Christmas. As soon as you get vacations, you may come here and from here we can go by car with friends. Let us talk in person about other details.

I am writing this letter so that you don’t feel annoyed for not having written letters so far. I was extremely unwell on the 25th and 26th. In Araga, the T.A. Mandal have agreed to the proposal of starting a school during the coming year.

In this regard, our Araga friends have donated Rs. 5000/- for the same. Due to ill health, I have not been able to participate in the fund collection effort on all the days. Please let my friend Lingappa know about this.

Rest in Person, Best Wishes,

Truly Yours,

**Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri**
