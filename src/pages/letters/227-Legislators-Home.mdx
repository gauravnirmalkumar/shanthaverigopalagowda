Your First Letter reached. I felt extremely happy. I wanted you to write first and You wanted me to write first (You First!) – In this game, you lost. I wanted to write to you even before our marriage, but because of some kind of shyness, I did not. Now there are no barriers between us.

Last evening, along with the famous Hindustani singer (In Drupad) from Jaipur, Brother Dagar, I visited Sri. B.V. Narayan Reddy’s house (in BalareddyPalli) and after having breakfast in the morning on our way back, we visited Nandi Hills and got back here. My friend Patil was driving the car. When I returned and looked for letters, I saw your letter too. First I saw your friend’s letter. In the evening I got the card that you wrote to Mulkar. The copy of the letter that you have written to the D.P.I. has also reached. About the posting, not only the President, Baliga but also the Ministry seems to be interested! It wouldn’t be difficult to get the posting in the school of your choice. I shall also try.

This Conference is likely to get over by the 3rd of April. The program after that needs to be found out. Leaving you and going to our home towndoes not seem right. Should you be appearing for the exam, it may not be possible to go to the town until April 22nd. Where should I stay until then? What should I do is the question. “Even if only for a few days, I want to focus and wish to pass in at least 2 papers or so. My thoughts towards you are also growing.” What will this distracted mind achieve in the pursuit of the upcoming exams. I will not say No. The decision is entirely yours and you will definitely complete your studies.

Since you have the determination to sit for at least 2 to 3 exams and clear them, you may follow through on this plan. After that, our travel plans and other programs can take shape. You decide and let me know.

I have not yet received the photos. I will send them as soon as soon as I receive them. I shall convey my regards to all that you wanted to. I will ensure that your letter to our friend Mulka reaches him. I have also sent your friend’s letter too. I have not written a letter to him yet because, I had to abandon my train journey and take the bus journey.

It would be a big mistake not to ask for his forgiveness for not being able to meet him. I was impressed by your language. The written alphabets need to improve. Its probably due to nervousness that your hands were shaking!!

Thinking as to why I should trouble the neighbours by repeatedly making trunk calls, I am writing this letter. I have written in a hurry. So, That’s All? Please convey my regards to Mother-in-Law and Father-in-Law, Vemanna and his wife, to your Younger sister, to your colleagues and Friends. Please visit the home of Friend Pujara and Dr. Pal.

Yours always,

### Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri
