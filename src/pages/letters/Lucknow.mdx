Dear Sonu,

I reached Hyderabad on the 22nd evening. On 24th, I went to Warangal and met Shri. Appayyanna. There is a nice match for Chi. Sou. Jaya, I have written to Appayyanna today, saying that if they accept, the match can be finalized. The meeting of the bride and bridegroom can happen in December. When Shri. Appayyanna comes on a vacation to Bangalore-Shimoga, next steps can be taken.

I left Hyderabad on the 25th and reached here on the 27th. Today, I am likely to go to Patna. There, I shall finish my programs tomorrow or day after, return to Delhi and if possible, come back around 2nd or 3rd to Bangalore. If for some reason, I am unable to, I shall keep you informed. Now, my back pain is gone. But on 22nd night, I had stomach pain. I visited the Doctor and have taken some medications. It looks like the infection that surfaced in â€™62 has come again, also Blood Pressure. I have been taking tablets. Winter here has begun. Two days ago, I paid Rs. 50/- and purchased a full sleeved sweater.

If time permits, I shall meet your friend at Delhi. I shall come to Bangalore either on 25th or the 3rd. If it gets delayed, I shall stay back in Delhi, and on 7th -8th, I shall finish with the Raichur conference and head back to Bangalore. Please ask Shri. Lingappa to find out and write to me if the Raichur conference is happening as originally scheduled on the 7th and 8th.

Trust that Chi. Ila Geetha and Chi. Rammanohar are keeping good health. Please pay attention to your health. Please be loving with Lakshmi Devi.

Please write to the Delhi address. Best Wishes.

Yours Truly,

**Gopalgowda Shanthaveri**
