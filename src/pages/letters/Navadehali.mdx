Dear Sonu,

Our Travel to Delhi happened without any difficulty. Today evening, I shall be leaving by Brindavan express at 6 in the evening and coming back to Bangalore.

In Kolkatta, we stayed in Yashwanth’s house for a day. We are all doing fine. You had mentioned that you would write a letter. It seems like you haven’t. I had sent a telegram from Madras. They had arrived at the station, picked us up and took us home.

I hope that you travelled to your home town and returned back to Bangalore safely. I hope Ila(daughter) is doing fine. Seetha also travelled along with us. All the money is exhausted. Hence, I am not carrying anything either for you or for Ila. We are staying at our friend, Patel’s house. He along with his wife and son are coming to Bangalore. If it’s possible, do come to the station.

Rest in Person,

Best Wishes,

Delhi,
