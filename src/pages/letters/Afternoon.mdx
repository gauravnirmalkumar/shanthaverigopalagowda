Dear Sonu,

Last evening at 5 pm, I was in a dilemma about whether to go to Sagara. Between 5 pm and 7 pm, my mind was restless. However, I did leave and sat down in the train on time. My friends, Maheshwarappa and Ramesh came. Until 11.20 pm, since we were just sitting and chatting, we did not get sleep immediately. Since I did not get enough bedsheet to cover, i found it a little uncomfortable. Most importantly, not making proper arrangements for drinking water was a mistake. Had to remain thirsty as there was nothing to drink. I was able to sleep after we left Tiptur. I woke up when we reached Bhadravathi. We reached Sagara by 10.20 in the morning. My friends, Thimappa, Chandrashekar and others came to the station to pick us up. Went to the guest house and completed bath etc. Food has arrived and is waiting for us. At 1 pm, there is a procession and then after that the assembly session. My Shimoga friend has not yet arrived, but should be coming. I shall go to Thirthahalli tomorrow and write to you in detail.

Today, its a holiday for you. I trust that daughter, Ila Geetha and son, Ramamanohar are doing fine and not troubling you with their mischief. My beloved blessings to them. Please take good care of them. In the hurry to leave, I forgot to discuss about the car. My friend must have written a letter and posted it to the Sait. I have to leave for the assembly. Because of lack of time, I am unable to write the details, please take care of things at home, I trust that Chi. Krishnamurthy, Grandmother are keeping good health.Please take care of your and the childrenâ€™s health and take sufficient rest.

Yours Truly,

**Shanthaveri Gopal Gowda**
