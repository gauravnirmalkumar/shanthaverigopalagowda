Dear Sonu,

Your letter hasn’t reached. The letters and the roots that you have sent through Lingappa have reached. I have been informed about the matter that you had conveyed earlier through Lingappa. Saying that he will understand the matter in detail and then let me know, he had left and not yet arrived. He may come either today afternoon or by tomorrow.

We reached Sagara on October 3rd. The assembly session happened in the afternoon. I am lodged at the Travellers Guest House. I visited Shri. K.V. Subbanna’s residence on the 3rd. In the evening, I met the Pandit. (Kodada Katte) On 4th, I reached Thirthahalli. I stayed at the Travellers Guest House. On 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th, I was staying at the Travellers Guest House. I changed to another accommodation on the 8th. I am right now staying there. Food is being prepared in Sri. Ramappa’s house and being sent. On the way to Thirthahalli, I visited mother and spoke to her. She is keeping good health.

As per the information that I have received, although you have holidays, because of the ongoing exams, you continue to go to school. I hope that you have made appropriate arrangements for the care-taking of the kids. What are you plans next? My programs ahead are still not clear. My health has improved now. I don’t have the courage to make long distance travel. Not being able to sleep, friend Sri. Purushottama Gowda is by my side to help me. Its been 8 to 10 days since I have come here. If its possible, you may send word to Sri. Nagappa and using a small car, if you come here along with the children, we can go to Agara, see mother, visit Harihar, Dharwad and come back. Please inform that I have insisted on a driver who can drive and accompany us for about 8 to 10 days, for the time being even if you and the children wish to stay in Bangalore, that’s fine by me.

Yours Lovingly,

**Shanthaveri Gopal Gowda**
