Dear Sonu,

I was able to sleep last night. Feeling better. In the morning, Dr. Vishwamoorthy came. He told me that he met Shri. Lingappa in Shimoga, I heard that you had said that you would also be writing a letter. I should receive it either today afternoon or tomorrow. I trust that both Ila Geeta and Ramamanohar are doing fine. My love and blessings to them always. I hope that Chi. Krishnamurthy and Granny are keeping good health. I have left a letter for Shri Nagappa. Please hand it over to him, after receiving a proper response and letting him know about your plans of leaving from there, you may start out from there. After you arrive here, we can plan the future program and proceed forward. It would be convenient if you could carry a small electric stove from home. It would be safe to carry kids’ clothes, mattress, bedsheets and other necessities. Now its vacation tme for you, but your school program is not clear yet. If you make up your mind, you can be here for Deepavali. Please do, as you deem fit. Please inform news about Dharwad. I have just kept my previous letters as it is. It lacked direction and my mindset was in a dilemma. Who were all the people that visited home? Please let me know in detail later. On the 8th evening, I left the Travellers home and arrived here. Umappa is getting me food. As I am writing this letter, I feel that instead of getting unnecessarily tensed and worried about various issues, it would be better to keep them aside and complete this letter. It would be better to discuss these issues face to face. I have to post this letter. My health is improving. The house that I am currently residing in is Shri Nagendraraya’s. Since he hasn’t come here to stay it is available. I am lucky that has given me an opportunity to stay here. It is peaceful, big and beautiful. There is absolutely no problem. I am hoping that you and the kids can stay here for a few days without any problem. There are so many things to be written, but it would be better to discuss these with one another in person.

Best Wishes,

Yours lovingly,

**Shanthaveri Gopal Gowda**
