Dear Sonu,

After visiting the new town Sagara, I arrived here. This evening, there is Tea in the old assembly. We have an invitation in the night for a Drama Event. TomorrowI shall be going to Eduru, On the 7th, 8th and 9th I shall be at Gowdamara, Sorabha and Shikaripura respectively. After completing this travel, on the afternoon of the 10th, I shall take a bus from Shimoga and be at Bangalore by night. Should that not happen, there is a train on the 11th morning. Please keep Mr. Shivappa and other friends also informed about these travel plans.

I couldn’t visit home again. If it’s possible, on the 7th, on my way to Gaumuchala, I shall stop at Araga, visit home and proceed further with my travel. I hope you reached Bangalore without any problem. You must be getting bored alone, but this is unavoidable as each of us must do our duty.

With Best Wishes,

Yours Truly,

**Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri**
