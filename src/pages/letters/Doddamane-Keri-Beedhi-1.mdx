Dear Sonu,

Your elder brother had come to Agara. This morning, he left to Shimoga. He informed that mother is not cooperating with food and treatment. She isn’t sleeping properly at night. Morning, she had just a little bit of coffee. At home (in Shimoga), sister-in-law apparently isn’t keeping good health, so he said he would go and visit their home. I am right now in the same home. Food, coffee etc. comes from Ramappa’s house. My health is improving. Many issues are agitating my mind. Dr. Vishnumurthy updated me about all of you. I must be busy taking care of the kids and attending to school work. In the previous letter, Ramamanohar had written asking how i spend my time. Even now, its the same worry. Whatever happens, please keep writing letters. I had written mentioning that until my confirmation, all of you must not leave Bangalore. Since you can’t avail of leave and since it would be difficult to go from Sagara and come back, I wrote that way. Its not close by! When the train was leaving Sagara, Ramu said angrily that I must definitely come to Bangalore. I will come. As soon as Granny’s health improves, “Mother, in your head, I am a child”, say this loudly. Your elder sister must be going to school. Children, please don’t trouble your mother. Here, I am not happy. Bangalore’s Narayana, s/o Giriappa, House No. 60, 5th Cross, Srirampura, Bangalore – 21, his letter has gone to Sagara and has reached here after a lot of delay. On the 1st, I had to participate in the Shimoga Rajyotsava. Shri Puttaswamy knows the friend whose letter has arrived. Please ask Puttaswamy to keep him informed, another person, K. Lakshman, Srinivas Cycle Mart, Gayathri Nagar, Srirampuram, Bangalore – 21. I won’t be able to come back to Bangalore on the 7th.

I am going to end this letter here. I will wait for your next letter and then reply. Let Ila Geeta and Ramamanohar, both pray for their Granny’s Life. You also pray. I trust that you are all doing fine. Friend Lingappa must be in Bangalore. He wasn’t there at Shimoga on the 1st. Everything else is ok. I hope that Granny and Krishnamurthy are fine.

Yours Lovingly,

**Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri**
