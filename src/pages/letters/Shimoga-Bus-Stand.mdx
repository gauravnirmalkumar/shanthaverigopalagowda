Dear Sonu,

I got a bus at the Toll area. But I did not find any seat. I had to stand all the way until I reached Hubli. Just as I started saying “Shimoga…”, a Coolie Boy informed me that the Bus to Shimoga had already left at 6 am, when I heard this, my heart sank. I sat on the 7.30 am Hubli-Bangalore Express, the bus broke down at Haveri and I had to wait for 1 and half hours before we proceeded from there. At 12.30 pm, we reached Harihara. There I got held up and had to wait for about 1 hour. I left Harihara at 1.30 pm and reached Shimoga at 4 pm. By then, my friend, Patel and others were waiting and took me by car to Thirthahalli. I was ready to go by bus to Thirthahalli and I am writing this letter from the Thirthahalli Bus Stand and posting it to you. The reason I am writing the details of my journey is such elaborate fashion is so that you are able to plan better and don’t face these kinds of problems when you are travelling on the 22nd.

I shall be travelling to Shimoga again on the 18th. On that day, in an another letter, I shall write to you about the details of how better to travel. Your exam question papers must be laughing at your situation. So what if they indulge in laughter, your success is guaranteed. Please attend on all days, after that take complete rest and only after that must you travel to Shimoga.

Please convey my regards to all, please write to the Shimoga address.

Regards,

Shimoga Bus Stand.

Truly Yours,

Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri
