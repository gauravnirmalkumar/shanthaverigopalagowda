Dear Sonu,

Since i couldn’t sleep last night, I am feeling tired. I tried to write a letter yesterday. However, I couldn’t finish it and post it. Ramappa went to Araga, spoke to Granny and returned. He has informed us that she is keeping good health. If a car is sent, she has agreed to come and visit here.

I trust that Chi. Ila Geeta and Ramu are keeping good health. Please convey my love to the kids. Your school work must be over. Please let me know about your immediate plans at the earliest. Although in my letter from Sagar, I had mentioned that i would write to you a detailed letter from Thirthahalli, I am sorry that I haven’t yet done so. Sri Lingappa who left to Bangalote saying that he would update me about all the goings on over there has not yet returned. The roots and the letter that you sent has reached yesterday. Please write after enquiring about everything, if you come directly to Thirthahalli, either you could go to Araga or get mother here, spend a few days here and then you could return to Bangalore. I feel that it may be difficult to go to Dharwad and get back at this point in time. If you get a car, you can bring the kids along. We can all go back to Bangalore together. Please check. Its up to your convenience. I trust that Chi. Krishnamurthy is keeping good health. I hope Granny is keeping good health? I hope you have completed learning to drive? Did you get enough rest and leisure? I feel that it may not be desirable to learn in a hurry. Don’t be disappointed that i wrote like this. I may not be able to write long letters. If I am able to sleep tonight, it would be good. The gentlemen, Phaniraj and Annappa must be visiting from time to time. Sri Phani’s election result could turn out to be quite positive. My trusted friends, Ramesh and Puttaswamy(Letters have come) must be visiting and enquiring. Please convey my regards to all of them. I met Dr. Vishnu Murthy, His wife, Smt. Rekha is 6 to 7 months pregnant. She is keeping good health.

There is light rain here. I am closing my letter. Please reply. Best Wishes.

Yours Lovingly,

**Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri**
