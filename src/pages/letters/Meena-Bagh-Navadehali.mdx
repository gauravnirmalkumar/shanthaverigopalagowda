Dear Sonu,

On the 29th evening, just as my letter was posted, I received your letter. Until 29th evening, not having received your letter, wondering whether the letter posted by me in Hubli had not reached, I wrote that letter. That letter also you must have received. Another letter of yours also reached me last evening.

Today morning, we were supposed to travel by Frontier Mail to Mumbai. Last evening we altered this travel plan. Now we are planning to leave on the 5th by Southern Express and arrive at Chennai. Today and Tomorrow, if possible, we would like to meet with the President and Prime Minister and place before them the pain of the Karnataka people and ask for justice to be done. That’s the reason, today’s travel plans had to be postponed.

For the first 2 days, I couldn’t meet anyone due to the State Assembly Session taking place. The Day Before and Yesterday, we got to spend time with your friend Shubha. She has received the letter that you sent. As per that, they have given me 1 pound woollen, 1 Chapathi making stone and 1 grinding stone. The plastic thread required for weaving a basket is not available. Since, this may be available in Bangalore itself, we decided not to look for it further. We also discussed about her emotional life partner. We had a candid chat. I shall share the details with you in person, when I return. I have said that we would write to him also. I shall meet her again before leaving if time permits. Her friend Kamala has gone to her home town and now she is alone. I could not visit Shri. Shastri’s place.

Shri. Kondareddy, despite my not wanting to, insisted that I should retain a judgement copy of his case. While I was sitting on the outside sofa having a shave, he came and placed the judgement copy on the footstool in front and left.

It is a typed document on Court Stamp Paper. It must be right there. You could also look for it on my table or in the drawer. You will find it with a little bit of effort. Please look for it and if necessary hand it over.

Sri. Ramachandra must bemad due to the disappointment. Nothing can be done. He is still here with his friend. I got to know through him. “He has tried to inform someone, don’t know what happened”, is what he said. Please console him by writing to him that I have informed you that in the future, when another opportunity crops up, I will definitely help him. Sri. Thutti Chandrashekhar’s son must have obtained a seat somewhere. If he enquires about me, please let him know that I would be back either on the 7th evening or on the 8th morning. Friend, Mulkashould be back to Bangalore tomorrow. I will ask him to make a telephone call to you.

It was extremely humid both yesterday and the day before. Today, the weather is cloudy. It is not that humid. It hasn’t rained. Dr.Lohia is also in Delhi. I met him last evening. Friend, Murahari is also there. They have stayed back is what I have informed in my previous letter. Everything else is fine. Instead of getting money transferred, I have taken a hand loan of Rs. 300 from my friend, Mulka.

Last evening, we had gone to Dr.Mahishi’s house. There, we met Anna Guruji, Appanna Gowda Patil(Belgaum) and others. Chief Minister and other colleagues are likely to come either today or tomorrow. All the enthusiastic groups are waiting with bated breath and on the decision that the Congress Working Committee will be taking on the 5th. We heard about the news of the Bangalore Bundh. We got to know more details about it this morning. We are also hearing reports of not much stir in a few parts. Please let Sri. Lingappa and other friends know that we would be arriving either on the 7th or on the 8th. If you write after you receive this letter, it may not reach. Hence, you don’t have to write. Rest in Person.

Best Wishes,

Yours Truly,

**Gopal Gowda Shanthaveri**
